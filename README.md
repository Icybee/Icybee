Icybee
======

Icybee is a CMS for PHP5.3.6+, brand new and wonderful, built on solid
components, fresh ideas and years of experience from his dad.

If you want to try the CMS for yourself please [download the demonstration](http://icybee.org/icybee-demo-latest.zip) and follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/Icybee/Icybee/wiki/Installation-guide-for-Icybee%27s-epic-demonstration).

An online demo
--------------

A demonstration is also available online but you won't have access to the administration interface yet :( Still you can check it out at the following address:

What can be done with it ?
--------------------------

Apart from its [author's website](http://weirdog.com/) and the demo, there is no website currently available to see what's possible to create with Icybee. Still, you can check what its ancestor was capable of and dream about what Icybee is now capable of, after eight months of development:
