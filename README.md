Features
--------

### Ready out of the box

Out of the box you have everything you need to manage your news, images, files. You can edit
complex contents thanks to the many editors included. Create a website. Create some pages. Choose
where to display your lists and details. You can even choose the pattern of the URL of your
records.



### Multisite, multilanguage

Your website should be translated, or you want to manage multiple websites using the same instance
of Icybee ? Just create a new website using the administration UI and choose the relation between
your websites.



### Views, CSS and JavaScript

Modules that manage contents–such as Articles, News, Press release, Job offers...–comes with all
the views, CSS and JavaScript required to display their content. As such, adding news support to
your website can be done in seconds.
