MooEditable images
==================

The toolbar button image is generated via the [CSS Sprite Generator](http://spritegen.website-performance.org/), with custom settings of 'Horizontal Offset: 0.0px' and 'Vertical Offset: 0.0px'. The image is then manually converted from True Color to 256 with transparency.
